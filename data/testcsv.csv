TACTICAL,,,,,
CONFERENCE ROOM - LARGE,,,,,
,,,,,
Design Intent ,,,,,
Guideline,,This enclosed space is designed for team meetings of 16-20 people| primarily in a presentation style. During the design phase| consider locating the space as a •À_landmark•À_ to aid in way-finding / circulation. Successful design of this space will require that the functional aspects perform to serve its primary purpose. Though the conference room may be located along an exterior wall| access to natural daylight should be prioritized for work spaces. Appropriate viewing angles to the projected surface must be maintained for all attendees.  The challenge for the design team is to incorporate the standards as shown while finding opportunities through color| materiality| or other design elements to create a space that engages the occupants and supports a dynamic meeting.,,,

Lighting,,,,,
Guideline,,"Design to minimize glare| enhance video conferencing| and make writable/tackable surfaces legible.  Lighting levels need to be controlled and sufficient for viewing presentations| illuminating display or writeable surfaces| yet not create shadows or hotspots in the event of teleconferencing.Maintain uniform horizontal and vertical wash across seating area for VTC; front wall should be dark for displayCarefully consider lead times and plan design schedules when selecting lighting fixtures",,,
,,,,,
,Standard,Center ACT| lighting fixtures| LCD Projectors| and Motion Detector over table,,,
,,Direct lighting over conference table,,,
,,Consider Solid state LED light sources,,,
,,,,,
Furniture,,,,,
Guideline,,Design to accommodate a variety of collaborative activities| including presentation| brainstorming| interactive problem-solving| etc.  Seating should optimize viewing angles and distance to projection / video display.  Facilitate interactive use of vertical surfaces by ensuring appropriate clearance around furniture and writable/tackable walls.  Consider cost| project schedule| existing products| and cultural reference when selecting furniture,,,

Acoustics,,,,,
Guideline,,The room must be acoustically separated from surrounding spaces for privacy and to avoid distraction| and designers need to assure sufficient acoustic attenuation so that the sound quality inside the room is not harsh in the case of video or teleconferencing. Design to mitigate noise from adjacent spaces| mechanical/HVAC equipment| and reverberations within the room. Do not place Conference room near rooms that require large amounts of cooling such as cable rooms.,,,
